The Alias modules provides the ability to give aliases to long
classnames for display purposes ONLY. For example, I display
`dirty-owl-hackers' as `d-o-h'.

To use Alias, copy Alias.par into ~/.owl/modules, and create a
~/.owl/classmap file listing the (class, alias) pairs you want,
separated by whitespace. For example, my classmap file contains


--- CUT HERE ---
dirty-owl-hackers               d-o-h
--- END CUT ---

Then, from BarnOwl, execute the :reload-modules command.


Technical note: Alias assumes that you are using a ``new-style'' style
which uses the ``context'' field of the Message object for
display. Old styles which display $m->class of a zephyr directly will
not be affected by the display map.
